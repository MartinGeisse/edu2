like a real number, which isn''t very interesting here.

We write a vector as a column vector. For example, $\begin{pmatrix}4\\-0.5\\1\end{pmatrix}$ is a vector from $R^3$.
We call $R^3$ the vector space to which this vector belongs.

Letters without an arrow denote real numbers. This way we can easily distinguish between them.','{"rightAnswerScore": 35, "wrongAnwerPenalty": 100}');
