Cannot be worked from first principles. What would be another way to "always be one step from a safe place
knowledge-wise"?

recap:
- one new thing at a time
- connect to already-known things
- immediately support with exercises, even if it just repeats the content
- smalls steps in multiple directions, not several steps into the unknown
    - then connect and support each other
- repeat previous, if possible from different angles
- open question or unknown aspect as motivation
- combination exercise

With this in mind, process the videos:

Which procedure is best?
- define and specify the part to make. Go to the shop and decide in which order to make the features. Calculate the
  numbers for the individual measurements, then make the part.
- define and specify the part to make. Decide the order of operations. Go to the shop. For each feature, calculate
  the numbers for the individual measurements, then make that feature.
+ define and specify the part to make. Decide the order of operations. For each feature, calculate the numbers for
  the individual measurements. Only when you have all the numbers, go to the shop and make the part.

What is the main reason why it is preferred to calculate all the numbers before going to the shop?
+ the noise and possible physical dangers inside the shop make it hard to concentrate on calculations, and easy to
  make mistakes
- to occupy the machines for the shortest time possible
- ...

What is layout fluid used for?
- as a light coating to protect the surface from rust
+ as a light coating to make scribe marks visible
- as an adhesive for drawings and templates
- as a lubricant and coolant for tools
- to give the surface a more finished look

What is the main disadvantage when you spray too much layout fluid on a workpiece?
+ scratching through it scratches off flakes instead of a thin, precise line
- it will be harder to remove
- it wastes more layout fluid

What does a scriber do to layout fluid?
+ it scratches off a thin line of layout fluid
- it "draws" a thin line of layout fluid
- it puts the layout fluid on the workpiece

What is the thickness of a scribe line, and therefore the precision when using such a line as a reference?
    line thickness: 2/1000th in = 0.05 mm
        wrong answers: 2mm, 1mm, 0.5mm

Which parallels must be combined to draw a line parallel to the edge of a part, at a distance of 7/8in?
+ 1/2, 1/4, 1/8
- 1/2 and 1/4
- 1/2 and 1/8
- 1/4 and 1/8

Which method is more precise to mark a point in a corner, 1/2in from both sides?
    (image)
- use a ruler to measure 1/2in from the corner on each side, draw two lines perpendicular to the two sides, then
  mark the intersection of the two lines
+ use a 1/2in parallel to draw two lines, each parallel to one side at a distance of 1/2in, then mark the
  intersection of the two lines

What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a ruler over using parallels?
+ using the ruler is usually quicker but less precise
- ...

What error is possible when using parallels?
+ the parallels are not in contact with each other
- the parallels are usually not made with high precision
- ...

What is the purpose of a center punch?
+ the center punch makes a small dent in the surface, not just a mark on the surface
- the center punch scribes a point mark into the layout fluid
- the center punch paints a point mark onto the surface even without layout fluid

What is the main advantage of a center punch over only marking a point with a scriber?
+ the dent from the center punch holds a drill, leg of a compass, or other tool in place
- it is not necessary to cover the surface in layout fluid before using the center punch
- the mark from the center punch can be removed more easily than the mark from the scriber










mark a point to drill a hole with a scriber or with a center punch?
    + both, first scriber to "find" the point, then center punch

how can (even inaccurate) marks help in a machine with digital readouts?
    + easy to see when you are totally off, e.g. flipped digits or decimal point in wrong place

how to position the center punch accurately?
    + magnifying glass

use case for transfer punches?
    mark points at the location of holes of an existing parts
    - for through-holes
    - for threaded blind holes
    - for unthreaded blind holes

If position of the holes in the part don't matter, why clamp parts together when marking points with transfer punches?
    Absolute position of holes doesn't matter, but position of the holes relative to each other does.

Threaded transfer punches: Why screw them in until just the point sticks out? What happens if more than the point
    sticks out?
    + will lift and tilt the part and give inaccurate punch marks

adv/disadv of plotting a drawing and glueing it to sheet metal?
    adv: very fast; harder to make mistakes
    disasv: not very accurate
use this in which case?
    -> accurace not as important

DRILL PRESS

advantage of a drill press over a hand drill
    + drill exactly perpendicular to the surface
    - stronger
    - larger holes
    - drill deeper

what do the levers for the transmission change?
    + speed by which the drill bit rotates
    - hole size
    - hole depth
    - speed by which the drill moves down
    - speed by which the drill moves up

what does the power feed do?
    + moves the drill down automatically and at a constant speed

what is the main advantage of the power feed
    + pushes the drill down at a constant speed. When pushing by hand, you push in varying speeds and force, and can
      easily push down too hard and break the drill bit or even the drill press.
    - can do something else in the meantime
    - relax a bit in the meantime

when is the power feed especially useful to avoid breaking the drill bit or drill press?
    + when drilling a large-diameter hole

use of a center finder?
    + makes sure the axis of the drill is not moved against the axis of the hole to drill
    - makes sure the axis of the drill is not tilted against the axis of the hole to drill, that is, that the drill is
        exactly perpendicular to the surface
    - makes sure that the tip of the drill is in contact with the surface to drill

what to watch out for with a center finder
    + do not pull down too hard; just enough to maintain contact with the surface

what happens if you pull down too hard?
    the quill deflects, and the center finder will not show the displacement of the two axes accurately

how to choose drill size?
    + start with a center drill, then step up size until the desired hole size is reached

what happens if you choose a large drill too early?

what happens if you start with a small drill instead of a center drill?
    + the drill will wander off the center of the hole to drill, essentially drilling in the wrong place, because it
        is thin and flexible, so it needs the hole from the center drill to stay in its place

When tapping a hole (cutting threads into it), why would you want to use the spindle of the drill press to guide the
tap?
    + to cut the threads perpendicular to the surface

What to watch out for when guiding the tap with the spindle?
    + pull the drill press down firmly enough so the tap does not slip out. With the part clamped down, it is easy to
      break the tap that way.

What is the purpose of cutting fluid?
    + lubricate the cutting edge to reduce unnecessary friction
    + lubricate the sides of the drill, so the chips slide along the flutes and do not get stuck in them
    - cool the drill

What should you do when you hear chatter (vibration) when operating the drill?
    + reduce the drill speed
    - add cutting fluid

What should you do when you cannot switch the transmission?
    + rotate the spindle slightly by hand, until the gear teeth slide past each other

Why can't you use a drill press for milling?
    + because the quill of the drill press is too flexible for milling. It will deflect and not cut an even surface.
