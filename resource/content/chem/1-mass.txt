What is Av.N.
- number of particles in a mole
- number of moles per gram
- number of particles per gram
- number of grams per mole

What is the value of Av.N
- 4-5 values

Whatt is the average mass of one atom of (element) (link to PT)
- 4-5 values; masses, proton numbers, neutron numbers

Which element has an av mass of (value) (link to PT)
4-5 elements

One molecule of methane (CH4) consists of one carbon atom (C) and four hydrogen atoms (H). What is its mass? (link to PT)
4-5 values

A H+ ion is a hydrogen atom that has lost its electron. What is its mass? (link to PT)

An OH- ion consists of an oxygen atom and a hydrogen atom, but also an extra electron. What is its mass?

(not backed by the videos, but appears in exercises!)
- Masses taken from the periodic table: H (hydrogen): 1u, O (oxygen): 16u, Na (sodium): 23u, Cl (chlorine): 17u.
    We say that a molecule of water (H2O) has a mass of 2*1u+16u=18u. Likewise, we say that a formula unit of sodium
    chloride (NaCl) has a mass of 23u+17u=40u. What would be wrong about saying that a _molecule_ (instead of a formula
    unit) of sodium chloride has a mass of 23u+17u=40u?
    - a molecule of sodium chloride has twice that mass, 80u.
    - a molecule of sodium chloride has half that mass, 20u.
    - a molecule of sodium chloride does not exist
    (expl: Na and Cl exchange an electron to become Na+ and Cl-, then arrange themselves in a large crystal lattice
    without any discrete molecules. The formula NaCl refers only to the ratio of Na to Cl atoms in the crystal lattice,
    not to any discrete molecule.)

(Rechenintensive Aufgaben)
- How many atoms are in a (XXX) mg sample of (element) (linkt to PT; mole def; calculator)
- (Auszug aus PT mit Atommassen): calculate the number of moles in a (XXX) g sample of (molecule)
- calculate the mass in grams of a sample of (XXX) containing YYY atoms/molecules
