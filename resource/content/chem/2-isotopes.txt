Which is correct?
- isotopes of the same element have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons
- isotopes of the same element have the same number of neutrons but different numbers of protons
- isotopes of the same element have the same mass (sum of protons and neutrons) but different proton/neutron ratio
- isotopes of the same element have the same number of protons and neutrons but different numbers of electrons

Element X has A protons and B neutrons. What is its atomic mass?

Element Y has A protons and a mass of B. What is its number of neutrons?

What is the mass number?
- number of protons
- number of neutrons
- number of protons and neutrons
- mass of the nucleus in atomic mass units

How do the atomic mass and the mass number relate?
- they are the same, except that the atomic mass uses the unit u and the mass number is unit-less
- the mass number is the atomic mass rounded to the nearest integer
- the mass number is the atomic mass, rounded down
- they are roughly the same. The mass number pretends that all protons and neutrons have a mass of 1u each, that
  electrons have no mass, and that the atomic mass is the sum of both (as if there was no _mass defect_)

(choose other element, this is taken from KA) Chromium-52 is the most stable isotope of chromium. How many neutrons are
found in a single atom of chromium-52? (link to PT)?

We say that two atomic nuclei are isotopes of the same element if they have the same number of protons, regardless of
the neutrons. In contrast, we do not consider it to be very important whether the nuclei have the same number of
neutrons if their number of protons is different. Why?
- the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons, which define the chemical properties. In contrast, the
  number of neutrons does not directly relate to the electrons.
- because protons have much larger mass than neutrons, so the mass contribution of neutrons is dawrfed by the different
  number of protons
- counting protons is historically preferred to counting neutrons, so we stick with it. It would be possible to
  define everything "the other way round", by counting neutrons, with equivalent results.

TODO
Why do different isotopes of the same element have almost identical chemical properties?
- because chemical properties are determined by the electrons, and the number of electrons depends on the number of
  protons, which is the same for all isotopes of the same element
- (wrong answers)
-> (similar mass!)

Why do different isotopes of hydrogen have different chemical properties?
-> TODO

(rechenintensiv)
- the avg mass of (element) is XXX. It has two stable isotopes, AAA with mass A and BBB with mass B. Calculate the
  naturally occuring ratio of these isotopes.
- natural uranium has an atomic mass of XXXu. It consists of 0.72% of U-235 and 99.28% of U-238. Calculate the
  mass of U-235 in 1 kg of natural uranium.
- 1 mole of natural uranium has a mass of XXX. Calculate the mass of one mole of _reactor-grade_ uranium that has
  been _enriched_ to contain 5% U-235 and only 95% U-238.

Which is true in a mass spectrometer?
- heaver ions get deflected more
- heaver ions get deflected less

Which is true in a mass spectrometer?
- ions that are charged +2 get deflected more than ions charged +1
- ions that are charged +2 get deflected less than ions charged +1

A sample of (Element) shows three peaks in a mass spectrometer. Two of them, X and Y, are expected and correspond to its
known isotopes. What is the most likely explanation for the third peak at Z?
- a third isotope of the element exists that has not been discovered yet
- the sample has a ratio of isotopes that is different from the natural ratio
- the sample is contaminated with a different element
    TODO choose example values so this is the correct answer
+ the third peak is caused by ions that have been charged +2 instead of +1, so they have half the mass-to-charge ratio
    ... and not this

show mass spectrum -- what is the mass of the most abundant isotope?

show mass spectrum -- how many isotopes?

show mass spectrum -- which element is this?

show mass spectrum -- what is true?
- N isotopes
- most abundant isotope is X
- average atomic mass is X
- average atomic mass is between X and Y

show mass spectrum -- calculate average mass

average atomic mass of (element) is X. which of the spectra matches
