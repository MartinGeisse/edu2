Chemistry is understanding how substances behave. How _do_ they behave? We have to zoom in on a microscopic level
to understand that. If we do that, we'll soo some recurring patterns, like molecules, ions, lattice structures, and
so on.

But how to _those_ behave? If we zoom in further, we find that they are all made from the same building blocks: atoms.
Understanding substances, therefore, means understanding how atoms behave.

    + We want to understand atoms because they are the common building blocks for all substances
    - Atoms are one of the building blocks for substances; molecules and ions are others.

    + Understanding how atoms behave is the fundamental building block to understand how substances behave
    - Understanding how atoms behave, and understanding how substances behave, are two distinct branches of chemistry.

A single atom won't do a lot of interesting things on its own. Understanding substances means to understand how and
when atoms attract each other, repel each other, stick together, and so on. Most of chemistry is therefore dealing
with how atoms interact.

(sequential sheet)
* Why are interactions between atoms so important?
    + Because a substance is made up from a huge number of atoms that interact to give that substance its properties
    - Because dealing with a larger number of atoms makes it harder, and therefore more challenging, to do chemistry
* What are the main interactions between atoms?
    + attraction, repulsion, and sticking together
    - exchange of information
    - generating and destroying atoms

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Even though interactions between atoms are most interesting to us, we first have to understand how a single atom works.
This will give us the tools to understand interactions later.

An atom consists of two things, a nucleus on the inside and an electron shell on the outside. The electron shell
consists of a number of electrons and the nucleus contains of a number of protons and neutrons.

Here is an example of a lithium atom: (3p, 3e, m=7 -> 4n); marked p, e, n

(sequential sheet)
* Here is another atom, beryllium (4p, 4e, m=9 -> 5n) How many protons, neutrons, and electrons does it have? Just count them!
* Which is true?
    The nucleus of an atom contains protons and neutrons
    The nucleus of an atom contains protons, neutrons, and electrons
    The nucleus of an atom contains protons and electrons
    The nucleus of an atom contains neutrons and electrons

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's dive into how the atom works. The nuclei and the electron shells are electrically charged. This causes them to
interact through the electric force: like charges repel each other, and opposite charges attract each other. This
force gets stronger, the closer the charges are to each other.

Electron shells are negatively charged, and the nucleus is positively charged. This makes a shell stick very tightly
to its nucleus.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The electron shells are on the outside, so if two atoms get close to each other, their electron shells will repel each
other.

There are ways to counteract that force, and if we do that, we'll see that the shell of one of the atoms gets attracted
to the nucleus of the other atom, and vice versa, because they are opposite-charged.

Pushing the atoms even further, the atoms will start to share part of their shell. This shared shell acts like a strong
glue that makes the atoms stick together.

Finally, if we push even further, then the two nuclei will start to repel each other, because they are like-charged.

TODO exercises

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We'll need some numbers to better keep track of these forces. Luckily, the atom makes it simple for us, because all
charges are multiples of a single elementary charge, called $e$. An electron is negatively charged by $-e$, and a
nucleus is positively charged by multiples of $+e$.

The force is proportional to the charges: A $+1e$ charged nucleus will attrach a ($-1e$ charged) electron by the same
amount that two $-1e$ charged electrons repel each other. A $+3e$ charged nucleus would attract the same electron by
three times as much. To get the force between two charges, we have to multiply these charges.

This allows us to simplify writing the charges, so for example when we write about a charge of $-2$, we actually mean
a charge of $-2e$.

TODO exercises

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why can a nucleus carry multiple charges, but an electron only ever carries a single one? Remember how the nucleus is
actually made up from protons and neutrons:

    (image)

We never explained how protons and neutrons are different, and now is the time for that: Each proton carries a charge
of $+1e$, and each neutron carries no charge at all. So the positive charge of a nucleus is the same as the number
of protons in it!

TODO exercises
Which is true?
- a nucleus with 3 protons attacts an electron 3 times as much as a nucleus with 1 proton
- a nucleus with 3 protons attacts an electron 1/3 as much as a nucleus with 1 proton
- a nucleus with 3 neutrons attacts an electron 3 times as much as a nucleus with 1 proton
- a nucleus with 3 neutrons attacts an electron 1/3 as much as a nucleus with 1 proton
(something with an image of an atom, counting particles)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

combined exercise time!

* Why do we care about the number of protons in a nucleus?
    + Because they are the ones that attract electrons, and are therefore the cause of interactions between atoms
    - Because they keep the neutrons around, which are the actually interesting particles
    - Because the protons from different nuclei attract each other, and are therefore the cause of interactions between atoms
    - ...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If protons attract electrons, then what is the role of the neutrons? It turns out that they are not directly involved
in chemical interactions, and mostly make the nuclei heavier. It turns out, though, that "just making the nuclei
heavier" allows us to pull some cool tricks with them that will help us a lot in chemistry.

There _is_ one central purpose of the neutrons: They glue the protons together in the nucleus. Without them, the
(like-charged) protons would repel each other, and the nucleus would fall apart.

TODO exercises

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The electric force depends on the charges, but it also depends on distance: The closer the charges are to each other,
the stronger the force. Distant charges do not interact very much.

The most important example of this principle is how the electron shell of an atom sticks to its nucleus. Compared to
other atoms, the shell is very close to its nucleus, so the attractive force is very strong. A lot is needed to
break that force, and we'll later learn about how this can be done. For now, suffice it to say that just trying to
pull the shell away from the nucleus will not work.

For the same reason, when two atoms share part of their shell, they stick together very strongly: The shared shell
now sticks to both nuclei by a force that a very strong because the shared shell is so close to both nuclei. How can
it be close to both of them? Such a shared shell is streched between the nuclei to be close to both at some point,
and like a rubber band, it also pulls the nuclei together.

TODO exercises
* What happens when a shared shell pulls two nuclei together until they touch?
    + The nuclei won't touch. They will repel each other, because they are both positively charged, and that
        repulsion gets stronger and stronger the closer they come to each other.
    - The nuclei will stick together after they touch, but only as long as the shared shell connects them.
    - The nuclei will stick together after they touch, and even continue to stick together when they lose their shared shell
    - The nuclei will merge into a single nucleus when they touch.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An interesting thing happen when an atom has the same number of protons and electrons: Such an atom is mostly immune
against attraction or repulsion by the electric force. If we place another charge -- in this example, a positive
charge -- near it, then this positive charge will attract the electron shell, but repel the nucleus _by the same
amount_. This will slightly deform the atom, but way too little to pull the shell off the nucleus. Most importantly,
it will neither attract nor repel the atom as a whole.

We call such an atom _neutral_. Being neutral is one of the things that atoms "prefer" to be. Why do they prefer that,
and what does it even mean for an atom to "prefer" something? The atom interacts though the electric force a lot when
it is not neutral, until it becomes neutral, and then mostly stops interacting. So "prefer" really means that, just by
chance, atoms end up being neutral most of the time.

TODO exercises
* Electrons are in the electron shell, not in the nucleus, yet we'll often look at the nucleus to learn something
about an atom's electrons. How can this work?
    + The nucleus contains the protons, and the atom will have an equal number of electrons when it is neutral.
    -
* When two atoms bump into each other, afterwards they fly away from each other just like two billiard balls. But we
just learned that actually, the two electron shells repel, the two nuclei repel, and the shell of one atom attracts the
nucleus of the other atom and vice versa. These forces should cancel out. Why do the atoms still repel?
    + Because the electron shells are on the outside, so they are slightly closer to each other, making them repel
      stronger than the attraction towards the other nucleus.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Electrons and protons cancel out with respect to an outside electric force. This calls for a simplification: When
dealing with such an outside electric force, it is sufficient to look at the _net_ charge, that is, the difference
in the number of protons and electrons.

Let's take this atom as an example:

    (image: Li1+)

For the outside electric force, let's assume a positive charge that is close to this atom. That force will repel one
proton, and attract an electron by the same amount. It will also repel the second proton, and attract the second
electron by the same amount. Finally, it will repel the third proton, but there is no third electron to attract. So
the net force is the same as if our atom had only one proton and no electron. Our atom as a net charge of $+1e$.

Using this new concept, a _neutral_ atom is an atom with a net charge of $0$.

TODO exercises
* There is no strong attraction nor repulsion between two neutral atoms. Why?
* There is no strong attraction nor repulsion between a neutral atom and an atom with a net charge. Why?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just like an atom with net charge $0$ is called neutral, an atom with non-zero net charge is called an _ion_. Ions
are important because they _do_ react to an outside electric force. One of the obvious and most important of these
interactions is that two ions with like net charges repel each other, and two ions with opposite net charges attract
each other. Another one is that a large overall electric force can move all positive ions in one direction, all
negative ions in the other direction, and keep all neutral atoms in their place.

You will read the terms _kation_ and _anion_ in a textbook. A kation is an ion with a positive net charge, and an
anion is an ion with a negative net charge. Using more specific words will make it easier to talk about ions later, but
for now, we'll stick to _positive ion_ and _negative ion_ for simplicity.

TODO exercises

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's get to a more practical example. We said that a large overall electric force can move all positive ions in one
direction, all negative ions in the other direction, and keep all neutral atoms in their place. This can be shown
in practice.

First, we need a substance that contains ions. We also want the particles to float around in that substance easily --
if the ions are locked into their place, they cannot be moved by the electric force. We can get both of that easily
by dissolving table salt in water: The water is liquid, so its particles float around easily, and dissolved table
salt gives us both positive and negative ions.

Next we need a way to generate an overall electric force. We can do that by connecting a battery to two electrodes,
and then submerging the electrodes into the salt water. The battery will generate a strong electric force between
the electrodes, and the ions will react to that force.

We can see the movement of the ions by the fact that an electric current flows between the electrodes. In other words,
the water _conducts_ the electric current. It will do so better the more ions are dissolved in it, because the ions
are what moves the current.

Since in science, we'll always want to test if our understanding is correct, we can do so by adding more salt to the
water, and see if the current increases. We can also try with water that contains _fewer_ ions than tap water, called
_deionized water_ for obvious reasons, and see if the current decreases.

Finally, we can try to push current through dry salt, and observe that it won't work. Dry salt has lots of ions, but
they are locked into place and cannot flow freely to move the current.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We mentioned dry table salt in the last unit. It contains lots of ions, "locked into place" so they don't conduct the
electric current. How would that look like, and why would they lock into place?

The key here is that "dry" means no water, so we have _only_ the ions left. That means that everything is electrically
charged, and we have strong electric forces acting everywhere. The ions will naturally seek an arrangement where they
minimize and balance all these forces.

If we consider that two like-charged ions repel each other, and two opposite-charged ions attract each other, it
becomes obvious that the ions will arrange themselves in a way that opposite-charged ions become neighbors, and
like-charged ions are as far away from each other as possible. This is called a _lattice structure_, and looks like
this:

    (image)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The lattice structure can be used to explain why salt crystals are brittle. Materials can be brittle for various
reasons, but in the case of table salt, the ion lattice gives us the explanation.

What does it mean to be brittle? Suppose we hit a salt crystal with a hammer. "Brittle" means that there is no
internal structure that can absorb this large force, and instead leads to a large-scale shift between parts of the
crystal, breaking it. In contrast, a ductile material would be able to break a few internal bonds to absorb the
energy of the hammer blow, keeping the majority of the bonds intact.

But with table salt, it's almost the opposite: A force that is strong enough to shift part of the lattice will actually
move like-charged ions next to each other, breaking all bonds at once!

    (multi-step image or animation)

Even though this explanation will not help us with other brittle materials, at least we now understand why table salt
_must_ be brittle.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is something still lacking from our understanding of neutral atoms and ions: Let's first get back to how an ion
can exist at all.

For a positive ion, this is not that hard to understand. A positive ion is lacking an electron compared to a neutral
atom. The remaining electrons are attracted to the nucleus as usual. Such an ion can exist simply be the lack of an
electron.

Things are more complicated for a negative ion. A negative ion has an extra electron compared to a neutral atom. How we
would expect the electric force from the other electrons, and the force from the nucleus, to cancel out. However, if
they do cancel out, then no net force acts on the extra electron, and it would just fly away. So obviously, "net force"
is too crude as a model to understand negative ions.

Without "net force", we have forces from the nucleus, as well as the individual other electrons, acting on the extra
electron. The key here is that the electric force gets weaker over distance. For example, an electron that is near the
nucleus gets attracted by the nucleus in a stronger fashion than it gets repelled by another electron that is on the
_other_ side of the nucleus.
TODO-knowledge -- is that correct?
    Vermutung is ja; x1=-x2 states sind vorrangig; Kleine Abweichungen davon sind dreh-Vibrationsmoden

So if we arrange the movement of the electrons the right way, then we can actually make the nucleus hold more electrons
than it has protons. That's what happens in a negative ion, but we'll see later that it only works with a very specific
number of extra electrons to balance all the forces.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The other open question is: If we have positive and negative ions, why don't they just attract each other, bump into
each other, exchange an electron, and be neutral? We would expect that to happen by random change, and then the
neutral atoms would stay neutral because they are no longer affected by the electric force.
TODO-knowledge

Unfortunately, we are not yet equipped with the knowledge to answer that question in depth. For now, we'll have to
accept the fact that in reality, there _are_ cases where two neutral atoms would rather end up as oppositely charged
ions, and even exchange an electron to become ions, than stay neutral -- even seemingly moving that electron _against_
the electric force.
