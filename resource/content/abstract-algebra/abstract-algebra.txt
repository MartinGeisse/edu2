motivation? start with examples!
- maybe even literally START with examples, and extract common behavior
    "boxed string of capital letters" (boxed: to distinguish from variable names)
    -> use new symbol for semigroup operation
    + boxed string of lowercase letters; boxed string of digits (<- not numbers! leading zeroes!), ...
    -> common: string of elements from a given symbol set
    (ex: check if property X holds for strings)
- common structure: closed, associative, identity element; not commutative
    - another example: natural number multiplication
        - no inverse
        - BUT: is commutative -- strings aren't
    - another example: natural number addition
        - has inverse
        - is commutative
    - terminology: associative, commutative, identity, inverse; semigroup, monoid, group, commutative group
    (ex: list properties of structure X)
    (ex: which of these structures is a Y)
- presentation (monoid is the quotient of the free monoid by a set of relations)
