What is the purpose of using edu-app for learning CAST?
- to be a preparation / teaser for learning from the book?
- to be better or equal to learning from the book?
- to be worse to learning from the book, but appropriate for a wider audience?

Why is this important?
- it affects how complete this content must be (preparation --> need not be complete; preparation / may-be-worse -->
    smaller extent is okay)
- we cannot fully present the stories from the CAST book other by copying them, which (1) violates copyright and (2)
    runs counter to the idea of edu-app

-->
The fact that we cannot fully present the stories indicates that the CAST book should be required for anybody who
actually wants to do a CAST analysis. edu-app can prepare for that, and can prepare people to help with a CAST analysis
but not perform one on their own.

    Unfortunately, here we cannot present content that is actually superior to what exists, and at the same time
    we don't know if edu-app is inferior to existing concepts because what blocks us is, party, copyright. OTOH,
    there is a strong indication that edu-app cannot replace existing prose descriptions.

Ideas to counter this problem:
- fictional accidents (avoid copyright, possibly at the cost of credibility; but we don't discuss this problem inside
    the atoms so only few readers would notice, and we refer them to the CAST handbook afterwards)
- step by step development of the problem instead of one big text that contains all aspects

------------------------------------

The purpose of edu-app is to provide value that would not exist without it. This could be:
- people being able to do a CAST analysis, or at least something into that direction, who
    - would not read the book due to being too much to read, or too theoretical
    - would read the book but find it too hard (this is hard to imagine, but maybe it happens)
    - would not read the book because it is "not fun"
- people being able to support a CAST analysis who would not learn enough to do one on their own
- people being sensitized for CAST-like thinking, even when no CAST analysis happens around them
- people being made aware of CAST who "spread the word"


Replacing the book isn't value that would exist without edu-app, in particular because, for such complex topics, books
cannot be replaced adequately. So the right approach is to augment the book.
- fictitious accidents are okay. Understanding actual, real-world accidents fully runs counter to the idea of edu-app,
    though understanding them fully is what CAST is all about. So edu-app has to go there step by step. Fictitious
    stories also avoid copyright issues (since the only useful source for them is the CAST book).
- edu-app has to analyse singular parts to fit its atom format. The format should concentrate on one aspect of CAST
    at a time, not on one aspect of an accident (doing so would run counter to the idea of CAST and systems theory).
