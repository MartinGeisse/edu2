I am more and more convinced that react-query is not for me. It is based on the ideas
- that a query is a live thing, and may return a different result in the future
- that the key for a query determines its result, and the same result should be returned for the same key
    (definitely not the case for exercise generators)
- that query results can be shared
- that old results are better than a loading spinner (this can be disabled)

Probably all of these can be worked around, but together they indicate that I need a simpler tool with fewer features.
