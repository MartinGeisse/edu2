review: real numbers, rational numbers (fractions)
- which is real, which is rational (atom needed?)

no square is negative / root of negatives
- which are not real? checkboxes

i^2=-1 not real; imaginary unit (1 = real unit); imaginary numbers -> R*i
- which are real which are imaginary? checkboxes; includes R and R*i

(-i)^2 = -1
- which are real which are imaginary? checkboxes; includes R, R*i, R*i*i and R*i*i*i

complex numbers: computed though formulas of real and imaginary numbers
each real is complex; each imaginary is complex
0 is all of that
general shape a+bi; a, b in R
    subsets: a=0 or b = 0
calculating
    i cannot be combined with real numbers
    i*i -> -1
- which of these is complex? several formulas; correct answer: all of them
- which of these is real?
- which of these is imaginary?

2d coordinate system
- place a number in the 2d coordinate system
- tell the general shape of a number in the coordinate system

addition, subtraction: general shape
- add these numbers (given in general shape)

addition, subtraction: coordinate system -> vector concat
- add these numbers (given as points in coordinate system, place in coordinate system)
- desktop: mouse position -> show arrows
- mobile: hold touch -> show arrow

negation -- general shape
- negate these numbers

negation -- coords: mirror at 0
- negate these numbers (given / placed in coord sys)

multiplication of complex by real
- multiply these numbers (given in general shape / real)

multiplication of two complex; coords: harder to explain
- multiply these numbers (given in general shape)

division of complex by real
- divide these numbers (given in general shape / real)

division: (erweitern mit konjugierter)
- divide these numbers (given in general shape)

equality, inequality
- which of these numbers is equal to (insert general shape); multiple choices (check/radio?) given as formulas
    with addition. Best for flow: select-one; button matrix.

no gt/gte/lt/lte
- which if these inequalities is true, false, or undefined? multiple 3-radio-groups
    - ineq with complex/complex, complex/real, real/real

realteil, imagin채rteil; beide in R
    easy to read in (a+bi) but always defined
- compute Re, Im of given complex in general shape or formulas

komplex konjugierte (numbers)
- conjugate these numbers (general shape)

komplex konjugierte (coordinate system)
- conjugate these numbers

realteil, imagin채rteil daraus definieren
- jeweils nur sagen, dass man es so definieren kann; ex: benutzer muss die richtige Formel w채hlen

absolute
- berechnen aus general shape

----- TODO -------------

polar coords
(dt.: "argument") = winkel (Physik: Phase)
    linksrum gez채hlt
betragsquadrat, i.a. !=quadrat, immer reell
trigonometrie mit Argument -> Re, Im
0 kein Argument, aber als 0 definiert
exponentialfunktion, konjugierte dieser
exp(imag)
exp(complex)
jede complex als kartes. coords oder polar coords
multiplikation in polar coords
graphische interpretation
