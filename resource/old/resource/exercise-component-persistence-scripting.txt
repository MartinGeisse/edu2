Currently, an exercise IS a component, i.e. the exercise generator is a function that returns a (component) function
which then gets called through a JSX element. This makes the exercise generator AND the exercise non-scriptable
and the exercise non-persistable.

If instead the exercise generator is a script and the resulting exercise a plain data structure (JSON, Lisp tree,
whatever) then all these problems would be solved, BUT adding new exercise (UI) types must happen independent from
adding the exercises themselves. "Users" can only add exercise generators and atoms, but not exercise (UI) types.

Maybe that tradeoff is acceptable. For SaaS, the only alternative is to open the GUI-defining language to users.
(The same is true for non-SaaS, but it's not a problem there).
