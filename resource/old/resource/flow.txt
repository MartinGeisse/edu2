Users should immediately think, "I like the flow of this" when progressing through atoms.
- should not feel the desire to stop
- should be motivated to complete yet another atom before stopping
- should be motivated to "take a step to the side" and complete atoms out-of-order

To achieve this,
- atoms should not stretch too long
- atoms should have a similar "length" or "complexity", resulting in a similar length in time.
    -> complex topic? cut into smaller atoms
